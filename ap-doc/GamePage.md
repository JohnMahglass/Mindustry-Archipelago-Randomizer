# Mindustry

## What does the randomization do to this game?
Every research (excluding the research needed to complete the tutorials) is randomized. Units 
and Reconstructors are progressive items.

It is possible to randomize the player's core unit:
- Serpulo: Randomized weapon.
- Erekir: Randomized ability. (Core is made vulnerable as a trade-off since Erekir core unit is 
  usually invincible.)

## What Mindustry item can appear in other player's world?
Any randomized research can appear in another player's world. Upon being sent back to Mindustry, 
they can be used by the Mindustry player.

## What does another world's item look like in Mindustry?
Item from other player's are hidden in the tech tree's node (The box icon). When a location node 
is researched, the item name and owner will be displayed in the game chat.

## How to goal?

Currently, the only way to goal is to unlock the victory nodes (The star icon) for the selected 
campaign in the tech tree. If you have selected multiple campaigns, every victory nodes need to 
be unlocked for the goal to be completed.
