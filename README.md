### What has been changed from the vanilla game? <a name="introduction" />

- Save data are separated from vanilla game so that playing Archipelago doesn't erase your vanilla saves. (You should still backup your saves as this is in developement)
- Most node from the research tree has been replaced with location checks.
- A "Victory" node has been added, researching this node will inform Archipelago that the player has finished their World. If both planet are selected as a campaign, each victory nodes need to be researched to complete the goal.
- A new menu has been added in Settings to configure Archipelago's settings.
- You can use the chat to send messages to other client (If they support it).
- Use '/help' in the client to list all client commands.
- It is not possible to construct a fabricator if the associated unit has not been researched as well on Erekir planet.
- The research tree now shows every nodes. This change makes it easier to plan a route if you need to get a specific location.
- On Serpulo, some derelict has been removed to prevent the player from breaking out of logic.

## Version 0.4.0 changelog <a name="changelog" />
### Changes
- Downgraded game version to the last official Mindustry release.*
- Added new Conquest goal. This goal will require you to capture every **named** sector from the selected campaign.
- Reverted previous derelict change. Every derelict are present again in sectors.
- Added new "Progressive Drills" option. 
- Added new "Progressive Generators" option.
- Added new "Faster Conveyor" option. @Antydon
- It is now possible to play multiple Mindustry multiworld on the same computer. To do so, simply copy/paste the client into **another directory**.
- Added 4 new abilities to the list of possible ability on Erekir for the "Randomize core units weapon" option.
- The `/options` command from the client chat will now only display relevant information for your selected yaml option. (ex: Death link mode will not be shown if death link is not enabled)
- Added `/options f` command to the client chat to display every option chosen in the yaml file.

### Fix
- Fixed a bug where the logic would not consider the player able to produce Silicon on Serpulo if they did not have the ability to produce Graphite.
- Fixed AI on Erekir being 'frozen' on some sectors.
- Fixed a bug that would cause the death link signal to not be received until the player restarted their client.
